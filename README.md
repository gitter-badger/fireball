Fireball is a next-gen Html5 game editor built with extremely extendable structure. 

Fireball is currently using [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) and [Cocos2D-JS](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-html5) as game engine. We will be supporting more open sourced game engines in the future.

## Introduction

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/fireball-x/fireball](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/fireball-x/fireball?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The core of Fireball is an editor UI framework and an asset engine with tree view, scene view and property inspector. Beyond that are all plugins or packages. We designed Fireball to be deeply customizable, even on the game engine side.

Developers can create their own editor and plugins very easily. The editor features are deeply inspired by [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) which we believe has the most advanced game developing editor at the moment.

The desktop version of Fireball is cross-platform powered by [Electron](https://github.com/fireball-x/electron). Currently we test our distribution on Mac and Windows 7/8.1. Issues on other platform are welcome!

## Use Distribute Version

1. Download distribute version from [release page](https://github.com/fireball-x/fireball/releases).
2. Extract the zip file to a folder of its own. This folder can locate anywhere on your disk.
3. Click `Fireball.app` on Mac or `fireball.exe` on Windonws to launch fireball.
4. Have fun!

## Use Development Version

Currently the code in development version is not readable, we are truely sorry about that.
We will be refactoring overall project structure during Beta so that we can provide fully readable and commented source code for our engine and editor extension.
